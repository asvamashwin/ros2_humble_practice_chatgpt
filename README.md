# ros2_humble_practice_chatgpt
ROS2 problems generated from chatgpt Solved
As i progress my ros2 mastery, i wondered how we can make use of chatgpt. 

hence after each completion of a particular module i asked chatgpt to generate 10 problems in each topic covered and attempted to solve it.

To solve the problems i haven't used any auto suggest from copilot in VS code.

the autocomplete were turned off as well.

this is purely to get indepth on the mastery and get into practice with the framework
